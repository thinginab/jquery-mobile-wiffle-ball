				  <p>You are ready for the Big Leagues!</p>

<p>*** NEW IN 2.0.0 - Efficiently score 
Baseball and Softball too! **** </p>

<p>Version 2 added an option to handle all of the complex baserunning scenarios that happen when you really are running bases in "real" baseball or softball. Big League still has all of the benefits of quick one-handed scoring, so you can still score these games one handed from a player in the dugout! </p>

<p>Big League helps you easily score and track all of your real life backyard and sandlot baseball games where you use "ghost runners" or "imaginary runners" instead of running bases - in addition to scoring "real" baseball and softball. Other baseball scoring apps don't allow non-standard baseball rules and can't handle it when the batter is also on base - Big League does! Others require a dedicated scorekeeper to keep up - Big League can be scored by the batting team! </p>

<p>The interface uses big, simple buttons so that people who are waiting to bat can score the current at bat easily - you don't need another person to sit and scorekeep on paper! After you are done scoring, you get sortable stats - both standard and sabermetric for both batters and pitchers. These stats can be emailed to yourself or others so that you can paste them in excel or your website - you don't have to painstakingly key in at bats to excel to get stats anymore, either! </p>

<p>Big League was originally built for *Wiffle Ball, but it can be used to score all of the baseball and baseball-like games people play including: softball, stick ball, indian ball, and others. </p>
